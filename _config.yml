# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.

##### Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Site meta
title: Your Jekyll Portfolio
author_name: Taylor Shift
email: youremail@example.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.

# Deployment meta
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
baseurl: "/jekyll-portfolio" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
# Note: if you have your portfolio at YOURNAME.github.io, then
# you don't need a subpath, e.g. site is accessible at
# https://YOURNAME.github.io
